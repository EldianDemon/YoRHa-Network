# The Application is Under Development! 🚧

We are actively working on improving the functionality and stability of the application. Please note that some features may change or be added in the future.

# Getting Started 🚀  

Welcome to **YoRHa-Network**! Before you dive in, make sure everything is set up properly.  

## Prerequisites 📌  

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended): https://nodejs.org/en/download
- **Redis** (Must be installed and running): https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/

## Running the Application ▶️  

1. Start with this command to install dependencies:
 ### `npm install` 
 or try instead (There might be version conflicts):
 ### `npm install --force` 

2. Navigate to the backend directory:  
   ```sh
   cd server

3. Install dependencies for server part:
 ### `npm install`

4. Start the backend server using (don't forget to turn on Redis before starting!):
 ### `npm run dev`

Once the backend is running and Redis is set up, you're good to go! 🚀

5. Go back to the main directory ("Yorha-Network" folder)

6. Start frontend client using:
 ### `npm start`
